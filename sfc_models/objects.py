"""
objects.py

"Convenience module" that imports the high level objects into the name space.

Users can use:

from sfc_models.objects import *

to load up the standard objects.

This could have been done inside sfc_models, but that seemed somewhat riskier (and currently
does not work, as circular imports are created).

Note that syntax like "from sfc_models.objects import *" is frowned upon as being dangerous.
I have just added this in to avoid bloated import statements in example code.
